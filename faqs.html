            <h1>Car Maintenance FAQs</h1>
            <p>
                Anyone who has ever dabbled in DIY auto repair can tell you: you’re probably going to have some questions (and say some swear words) along the way.
            </p>
            <p>Our family has been in the automotive business for a long time and, throughout the years, we’ve noticed that customers often have questions about the same things. To save you time and make us look smart, we created this all-in-one resource
                filled with answers to the most common questions we hear, or have dealt with ourselves.
            </p>
            <p> Read on for helpful tips and tutorials from our team of automotive experts on everything from the dreaded check engine light to brakes, DIY oil changes, wipers, batteries, changing your tires, and more. There are no stupid questions. There
                are, however, bad DIY jobs—and we’d really like it if your car didn’t blow up.
            </p>

            <h2><a href="#">Why is check engine light on?</a></h2>
            <div>
                <p>Your check engine light came on, now what? These tips can help you determine whether your vehicle has major engine problems or just a loose gas cap.</p>
                <p>
                    We’ve all been there before. You’re driving along when you notice a yellow light out of the corner of your eye. A quick glance at the dash confirms your fear. It’s the check engine light. If you’re like most car owners, you’re not sure if you should continue
                    to panic or not, and you have little idea what that light is trying to tell you or how you should react.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What to do when your check engine light comes on…
                </p>
                <ul class="faq">
                    <li>
                        While it’s true that extreme problems like low oil pressure or an overheating engine will trigger your check engine light to come on, your dashboard has other lights and gauges to warn you of serious problems, and probably soon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A good rule of thumb is to always read your owner’s manual and learn about the different reasons that would trigger the check engine light to come on. It should also give you a tour of the other gauge and warning indicators on your dashboard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your check engine light is on, the first thing to do is look for a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Check your dashboard gauges and lights for indications of low oil pressure or overheating. These conditions mean you should pull over
                        and shut off the engine as soon as you can find a safe place to do so. On some cars, a yellow “check engine” means investigate the problem, while a red “check engine” means stop right now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, try tightening your gas cap. This often solves the problem. Keep in mind that it may take several trips before the light resets. Some vehicles have a separate indicator that warns of a loose gas cap before the condition sets off the “check engine”
                        light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce your speed and, if possible, the weight you’re carrying. If the”check engine” light is blinking or you notice any serious performance problems, such as a loss of power, reduce your speed and try to reduce the load on the engine. For example, it
                        would be a good idea to stop towing a trailer. Have the car checked as soon as possible to prevent expensive damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>Even if you don’t notice an extreme problem, you should definitely still have the check engine code read and the problem fixed. If you want to diagnose the malfunction yourself, you can buy a scan tool at most auto parts stores. Prices
                        range from about $40 to several hundred, depending on the model and the features. These tools will give you instructions on how to decipher the engine codes. If you don’t have to mechanical skills already to diagnose and fix the
                        problem, it’s a more cost-effective decision to go directly to a service centre.
                    </li>

            <h2><a href="#">What is powertrain warranty?</a></h2>
            <div>
                <p>A warranty is a statement made by either the seller or the manufacturer of a product or service promising that it will perform in a specified manner for a specific period of time. When shopping for a vehicle you often hear the term “powertrain
                    warranty”. A powertrain warranty is generally a promise to repair or fix an issue with the parts of the powertrain should a malfunction arise based on the agreement signed by the buyer.</p>
                <p>The powertrain of a car consists of multiple components…</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engine</li>
                    <li>Transmission</li>
                    <li>Driveshaft</li>
                    <li>Any of the internal workings of the engine</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Simply put, the powertrain provides power to the car…</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Power is created by the engine, and then transmitted to the driveshaft through the transmission.
                    </li>
                    <li>The sensors that are generally included in a powertrain warranty provide input and output to and from the powertrain control module (PCM).</li>
                    <li>Some sensors send the computer information, which transcribes the information and sends it to output sensors.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2><a href="#">How do i change my car battery?</a></h2>
            <div>
                <p>No car batteries last forever. Things to take note of: are your headlights dimming, how old is your battery, has your car needed a jump-start; then maybe it’s time for a new battery. You should bring your car to an experienced and trusted
                    mechanic but if you have to do it yourself here are some rules. Changing a battery is a quick and easy job in most cars and vans and can be done with minimal tools.
                </p>
                <p>The most important thing before you begin is to make sure the battery needs to be replaced…</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for build-up in the form of a whitish or blue residue around the terminal – removing this can sometimes solve issues. Note: do not touch this powder it can often contain dried sulfuric acid, which will corrode your skin.</li>
                    <li>Verify that the battery has been given the chance to recharge by driving constantly for 30 minutes (with minimal electrical usage, including not running the air conditioner).</li>
                    <li>Check the alternator. Some cars also have a battery meter, with the engine running, the alternator usually maintains a charge close to 13.8-14.2 volts in a properly functioning charging system. The battery should have 12.4-12.8 volts
                        with the engine off, and with no accessory load.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remove the cigarette lighter and plug the memory keeper into socket. If you don’t have a memory keeper make sure you have all the PINs for your electronic equipment before you start. You may wish to check your car manual to see what devices
                    may be affected.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Locate the battery – The battery should be located in an accessible part on either side of the car’s frame. The battery is a rectangular box with two cables attached to it. In some European cars the battery is under the matting in
                        the trunk, or inside the fender of the wheel well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Identify battery terminals – Locate the positive and the negative terminals. The positive terminal will have a plus sign and the negative terminal will have a minus sign.</li>
                    <li>Disconnect the negative terminal – Loosen the negative clamp with a wrench and slide it off of the terminal. It is important that you disconnect the negative terminal socket before the positive terminal socket. Otherwise, you may short
                        circuit the positive terminal to a grounded part of the car.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
